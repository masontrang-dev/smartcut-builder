# SmartCut Builder v1.0 – Project Overview & Mission

## Mission

Empower woodworkers, hobbyists, and professional carpenters to design and build custom furniture and cabinetry with precision, ease, and AI‑driven guidance.  
The goal is to **reduce mistakes, optimise material usage, and provide step‑by‑step instructions** while allowing optional custom design enhancements.

## Scope

- **Core functionality** – cabinet & carcass builder, drawer/door sizing, clearances, cut lists.
- **Optional enhancements** – shaker panels, splines, custom legs, inlays, floating tops, and more.
- **Tool‑aware guidance** – workshop profile that adapts instructions to the user’s toolset.
- **Visualization** – 3‑D preview, optional AR/room‑preview, and export to common CAD formats.
- **AI Assistance** – error prevention, design suggestions, auto‑complete, cloning, and cost estimation.

## Motivation

1. **Precision** – Every dimension is mathematically verified.
2. **Learning** – Built‑in tutorials, templates, and a growing community.
3. **Efficiency** – Cut‑sheet optimisation, material cost estimates, and phased build plans.
4. **Creativity** – Optional custom‑feature wizard for advanced users.
